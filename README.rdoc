# Bookstore

Bookstore is a Ruby on Rails application that features both simple and sophisticated search functionality. 
With the simple search, the user can search books stored in the application's database by their names. 
With the more advanced search functionality, books can be searched by name, author, price or isbn number. 

The entire application only took me about an hour to put together (I didn't bother with any style 
or UI improvements). You can run this application by cloning it, and then running `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, and `rails server` in your terminal.
